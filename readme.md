### Project Description
Here I develop a series of models to evaluate effect of common ecological processes on the stability of predator-prey interactions. Specifically, I develop a simple discrete-time Lotka- Volterra model (the “base” model) that serves as a reference model to judge model stability. I then evaluate the stabilizing effects of density dependence and prey handling time, as well as the interactive effect of the two. I interpret the results of these simple models with respect to real world predator prey systems by extrapolating my understanding of mathematical models to what each implies about actual predator-prey interactions.
